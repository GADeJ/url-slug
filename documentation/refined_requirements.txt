1 Create a random short link for arbitrary URLs, e.g., bit.ly/2FhfhXh
    1.1 Short link must be between 6 and 10 alpha numeric characters
2 The same URL should always generate the same random shortlink
    2.1 Return short link
3 Allow creating custom short links to arbitrary URLs, e.g., bit.ly/my-custom-link
    3.1 Use same criteria as 1.1
    3.2 Omit 2.1 if custom short link to an already created url
4 Provide a route for returning stats in a given short link, including:
    4.1 When the short link was created
    4.2 How many times the short link has been visited total
    4.3 A histogram of number of visits to the short link per day
5 Of course, the server itself should handle redirecting short links to the URLs it creates
    5.1 Redirect then log time and clint information
